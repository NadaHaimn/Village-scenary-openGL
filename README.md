# Village scenary with openGL

## Description

The **Computer Graphics** project is a C++ application developed using Visual Studio. It showcases fundamental and advanced concepts of computer graphics, including rendering, transformations, and graphical operations. The application serves as an educational tool for learning and exploring various computer graphics algorithms and techniques.

This project demonstrates:
- **Rendering**: Basic 2D and 3D rendering pipelines.
- **Transformations**: Scaling, rotation, and translation of graphical objects.
- **Shading and Lighting**: Implementation of various shading models (flat, Gouraud, Phong) and lighting effects.
- **Interactivity**: User interaction to manipulate the scene dynamically.

## Features

### Rendering
- **2D Graphics**: Rendering of simple shapes like lines, circles, and polygons using algorithms such as Bresenham's line and circle algorithms.
- **3D Graphics**: Rendering of 3D objects with support for perspective and orthogonal projections.

### Transformations
- **Object Manipulations**: Scale, rotate, and translate objects in 2D and 3D space.
- **Matrix Operations**: Use of transformation matrices for efficient computation.

### Lighting and Shading
- **Ambient, Diffuse, and Specular Lighting**: Simulate realistic lighting effects.
- **Shading Models**:
  - Flat Shading: Uniform color for each polygon.
  - Gouraud Shading: Smooth shading by interpolating vertex colors.
  - Phong Shading: Per-pixel lighting for realistic effects.

### User Interaction
- Interactive controls to move, rotate, and zoom into objects.
- Keyboard shortcuts for toggling rendering modes and effects.
